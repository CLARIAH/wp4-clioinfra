9. Abstract (200 words)
- The Gini of the spread of education in the total population aged 15 years and older is given annually for the period 1850-2010 (the time period varies by country). 
10. Time period
	- 1850-2000.
11. Geographical coverage
	- Entire World.
12. Methodologies used for data collection and processing
- Bibliographical research, research of published and Online Databases, and cross-analysis of various datasets
13. Data quality
		i. Central statistical agencies
		ii. Historical reconstructions
		iii. Estimates
		iv. Conjectures
Virtually all benchmark data after 1960 (i.e. 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010) are derived indirectly from Central Statistical Agencies and therefore probably better classify as historical reconstructions. The remaining data are estimates. 

14. Period of collection
	- October/2010 and February/2013.
15. Data collectors
	- Bas van Leeuwen and Jieli van Leeuwen-Li.

17. Text
Obviously, educational inequality is related to education and the same data are used there. For the method of calculating years of education, the reader is thus referred to the file on "average years of education".  Here we will only give a brief description on how the educational Gini is calculated.
We use the method as suggested by Thomas, Wang, and Fan (2000), Checchi (2004) and Castelló and Doménech (2000, 4). In order to convert the educational information in educational Ginis they start with 
                                       
Where is average years of schooling in the population aged 15 years and over, i and j are different levels of education,  and  are the attainment per level of education, and  and  are the cumulative average years of schooling at each educational level. This equation can be rewritten as follows:
                                        
Where x stands for the average years of schooling per level of education (0= no education, 1= primary education, 2 = secondary education, and 3 is higher education) divided by the percentage population with at least that level of education attained.  , , , and  are the percentages of the  population  with no-, primary-, secondary-, and higher education respectively. 
	This equation gives the possibility to calculate the educational Gini for every year and country.



This data collection was carried out within the framework of the CLIO-INFRA project financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).
