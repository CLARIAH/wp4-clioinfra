17. Text

This study was carried out within the framework of the CLIO-INFRA project financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). Government debt as a percentage of GDP tells us something about the financial health of a country or region and can also be an indirect signifier of economic stability and development. This database provides figures for government debt as a percentage of GDP for a wide range of different countries around the world. 
Notes of interest: - In the case of overlapping data, precedence has been given to the World Bank figures.- Both the `Ethiopia (until 1993)' and `Ethiopia (from 1993)' data stem from the World Bank database, which does not make that distinction. The same goes for `Indonesia (until 1999)' and `Indonesia'. 
- While it is not entirely clear whether the data for `Germany' in the World Bank database for before 1991 refer to either West or East Germany, the assumption has been made that these figures refer to the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany). 
- Kyrgyzstan is called Kyrgyz Republic in the World Bank database, which is also its official name. Slovakia is called the Slovak Republic, also its official name. Occupied Palestinian Territory is called `West Bank and Gaza' in the World Bank database.
- Notable omissions include: the USSR, most of the Middle East and Central Asia, Vietnam, large parts of Africa, and most small countries. 
Overlapping data show that while in most cases the data are (almost) identical, there are also some significant differences between the Reinhart & Rogoff dataset and the World Bank dataset. Figure 1 illustrates this problem, showing a large inconsistency between the two when it comes to Australia:

One would assume that Reinhart & Rogoff are not measuring the same thing as the World Bank in this instance, but there are no directions for either dataset that support this assumption. 

Herewith the exact definitions of the variables measured:  

For Reinhart & Rogoff:
The standard variable used by Reinhart and Rogoff is `Total (domestic plus external) gross central government debt/GDP', unless mentioned otherwise (see below)

debt/GDP (%)

Tunesia Total gross general government debt/GDP 1991-2010

UK Total (domestic plus external) net general government debt/GDP (%) 1692-1979, 
1980-2010 Total (domestic plus external) gross general government debt/GDP (%)

Zambia Total (domestic plus external) gross general government debt/GDP (%) 1990-2010
Zimbabwe 2005-2010 (General government debt/GDP, IMF, World Economic Outlook)


For the World Bank:

The exact World Bank definition for `Central government debt, total (%)' is: 
`Debt is the entire stock of direct government fixed-term contractual obligations to others outstanding on a particular date. It includes domestic and foreign liabilities such as currency and money deposits, securities other than shares, and loans. It is the gross amount of government liabilities reduced by the amount of equity and financial derivatives held by the government. Because debt is a stock rather than a flow, it is measured as of a given date, usually the last day of the fiscal year.'
