9. Abstract (200 words)
- This dataset provides the annual number of Labour conflicts in a number of countries since 1927. Data is derived from the ILO publications Yearbook of Labour Statistics and the digital publications on www.ilo.org. The Yearbooks up to 1969 were digitized by the IISH by manually entering data into a spreadsheet. The ultimate aim of the dataset is to cover the entire world for the period 1850-2010.  The current version (version 1) was built as part of the IISH project "Global Hub Labour Conflicts".

17. Text
This data collection was carried out within the framework of the Global Hub Labour Conflicts financed by the IISH.

It is important to note that data on Clio-Infra is published within the framework of existing national borders. This means that some data as originally published does not cover these borders. E.g. Data on Vietnam (1954-1972) only cover former South Vietnam, while data on Germany (1945-1990) only cover the Federal Republic (Western Germany).
Note also that the way of collecting data differs per country, hence this data is not really comparable and the statistics only generally indicate the extent of labour conflicts in the different countries.
