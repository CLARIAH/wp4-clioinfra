9. Abstract (200 words)
The hunger rate represents the share of the people in a country below a fraction of a cost of basic needs poverty line. The fraction used by FAO is 52%, and I use that value for 2018. For years before and up to 1820 I linearly interpolate using a 80% value for 1820. The dynamic caloric requirement that is used to estimate the food component follows the FAO guidelines, and it is estimated based on height data from Clio Infra, and age-gender population distributions from UN and Mitchell. The protein content is 0.83 gr per kg of body weight. The estimates cover the period 1820-2018 (yearly). It is expressed as a share, from 0 to 1.
