--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The indicator should be used for cross-country comparisons. It is based on standardized democracy measures, hence its values should be interpreted as relative and not as absolute measures of the degree of democracy. The time trend observed for a particular country does not reflects changes in the magnitude of democracy, but rather its relative position within the sample.
