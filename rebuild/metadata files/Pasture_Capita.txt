9. Abstract (200 words)

Pasture occupied roughly less than 1% of the global ice-free land area
for a long time period until 1000 A.D.. In the centuries that followed
the share of global pasture area grew from 2% in 1700 A.D. to 24% in
2000 A.D. (34 million km2). These profound land use changes have had,
and will continue to have quite considerable consequences for global
biogeochemical cycles and subsequently global climate change. 

10. Time period

	AD 1500 – AD 2000

11. Geographical coverage

	Worldwide

12. Methodologies used for data collection and processing

Historical population & pasture statistics are combined with satellite
information and specific allocation algorithms (which change over time)
to create spatial explicit maps, which are fully consistent on a 5
minute longitude/latitude grid resolution, and cover the period 10 000
BC to AD 2000.

13. Data quality

	1960 – 2000 period: good (FAO)

	Ca 1800-1960 period: fair for Europe and N. America, poor for the rest
of the world

	Pre-1800 period: rather poor, a few countries excepted
