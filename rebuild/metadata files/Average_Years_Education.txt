10. Time period
	- 1850-2000.
11. Geographical coverage
	- Entire World.
12. Methodologies used for data collection and processing
- Bibliographical research, research of published and Online Databases, and cross-analysis of various datasets
13. Data quality
		i. Central statistical agencies
		ii. Historical reconstructions
		iii. Estimates
		iv. Conjectures
Virtually all benchmark data after 1960 (i.e. 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010) are derived indirectly from Central Statistical Agencies and therefore probably better classify as historical reconstructions. The remaining data are estimates. 

14. Period of collection
	- October/2010 and July/2012.
15. Data collectors
	- Bas van Leeuwen and Jieli van Leeuwen-Li.
16. Sources
The data were derived by combining two main datasets. First, Morrisson and Murtin (2009) supply information of around 78 countries for 10-year intervals. Second,Van Leeuwen, Van Leeuwen-Li and Foldvari, has been published in a range of papers spread over the past years (e.g. Van Leeuwen and Foldvari, 2008a; Foldvari et al., forthcoming) and has been made available in a comprehensive format by Clio-Infra in 2012. The last two datasets, from Van Leeuwen et al. and Morrisson and Murtin, have been shown to be the ones with the widest coverage, the longest time span and the highest reliability (e.g. Foldvari et al., forthcoming). The methodology for the two is also roughly comparable, making it possible to combine the two sets of estimates into a single comprehensive dataset on educational development.

17. Text
As pointed out, most of the data are derived from census data or from existing studies. Yet. before the 1960s, when no benchmark estimates are available anymore, we have to rely solely on a perpetual inventory method. This method is partially based on Schultze and Fernandes (2009). This method is difficult to write down in equations, but perhaps easier to describe in words. If a person is, for example, going to school in 1900, a enrollment rate is calculate for that year (i.e. how many people enter school, divided by the relevant school age children). 10 years later, he/she enters 15. Hence, in 1915 we use the 1900 enrollment ratio and multiply it with the people age 5-10 in 1910. In this way we correct for any mortality that may occur in the meantime. This same procedure is done for all education levels, age classes, and years and leads to an estimate of average years of education with age specific mortality rates. 




This data collection was carried out within the framework of the CLIO-INFRA project financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO).
