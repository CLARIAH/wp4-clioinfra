17. Text
	
This study was carried out within the framework of the clio infra project financed by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). Long-term government bond yield tells us something about the financial health of a country or region and can also be an indirect signifier of economic stability and development. The actual variable measured within this database differs from country to country and from period to period; no single measure is currently available. 

Notes of interest:
- In the case of overlapping data, precedence has been given to the OECD figures.- No data for Belgium during World War I, while such data is available for the other Western European countries
- No data for Germany 1944-1947
- While the OECD dataset defines `Germany' as the state that was created in the year 1990, the data for this `Germany' goes back to 1957. It has been assumed that this part of the data refers to the Federal Republic of Germany (1949-1989).
- Richard Sylla provides data for both India and Pakistan. However, India's numbers go back to the year 1937, which probably means that the numbers used for 1937-1946 are for a different political and geographical entity than those from 1947 onwards. 
- Pakistan makes a jump 1975-1976 (5,77% -> 9,04%)
- Big jumps in the Mexico data 1991-2011
- Russia 1999: 87,38% (no pre-1999 data, sadly)
- Remarkably low rates for Switzerland during the 1980's. 
- The Sylla data not always refer to YTM (!). 
- Notable omissions:  
The whole of Africa except for South Africa
The Mid-East except for Israel
China, plus most of South-East Asia
Recent data (+/- 1960-2011) for South America
Mexico pre-1991
Most small (non-European) countries
Eastern Europe pre-2000

The exact variables are as follows: 

For the OECD (http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx): `Long term (in most cases 10 year) government bonds are the instrument whose yield is used as the representative `interest rate' for this area. Generally the yield is calculated at the pre-tax level and before deductions for brokerage costs and commissions and is derived from the relationship between the present market value of the bond and that at maturity, taking into account also interest payments paid through to maturity'.
