9. Abstract (200 words)
- The World Countries Population Size ratio dataset comprises information on total population per each country for the period 1500-2000. Data has been gathered and organized in 50-years intervals for the period 1500-1800 and in 10-years intervals for the period 1800-2000, using as geographical reference the current list of existing world countries. 
10. Time period
	- 1500-2000.
11. Geographical coverage
	- Entire World.
12. Methodologies used for data collection and processing
- This dataset is a slightly revised version of the one produced by Filipa Ribeiro da Silva for the CLIO Infra Project in December 2012. The most important differences can be summed up as follows:
-  Whenever estimates by Maddison where available, his figures are being followed in favor of estimates by Gapminder;
- For Africa, estimates by Frankema and Jerven (2014) for the period 1850-1960 have been added to the existing database;
- For Latin America, estimates by Abad & Van Zanden (2014) for the period 1500-1940 have been added.
