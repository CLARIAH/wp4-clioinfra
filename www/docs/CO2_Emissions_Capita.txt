9. Abstract (200 words)

The original source for carbon dioxide emissions are the estimates of
the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center (CDIAC; Marland et
al, 2004). Global, regional, and national annual estimates of CO2
emissions from fossil fuel burning, cement production, and gas flaring
have been calculated, some as far back as 1751 and extrapolated back to
1500. These estimates, derived primarily from energy statistics
published by the United Nations, were calculated using the methods of
Marland and Rotty (1984). Cement production estimates from the U.S.
Department of Interior's Bureau of Mines were used to estimate CO2
emitted during cement production. Emissions from gas flaring were
derived primarily from U.N. data but were supplemented with data from
the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration, Rotty
(1974), and with a few national estimates provided by G. Marland.
Timeseries are regularly updated till current time, see also the Global
Carbon Project (http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/)
