9. Abstract (200 words)

Sulfur aerosols impact human health, ecosystems, agriculture, and global
and regional climate. A new annual estimate of anthropogenic global and
regional sulfur dioxide emissions has been constructed spanning the
period 1850–2005 using a bottom-up mass balance method, calibrated to
country-level inventory data. Global emissions peaked in the early 1970s
and decreased until 2000, with an increase in recent years due to
increased emissions in China, international shipping, and developing
countries in general. An uncertainty analysis was conducted including
both random and systemic uncertainties. The overall global uncertainty
in sulfur dioxide emissions is relatively small, but regional
uncertainties ranged up to 30%. The largest contributors to uncertainty
at present are emissions from China and international shipping.
Emissions were distributed on a 0.5° grid by sector for use in
coordinated climate model experiments.
