9. Abstract (200 words)
This is a composite measure of wellbeing constructed from 9 variables from the Clio-Infra projected prsented in the How was life report. Newer version forthcoming.

10. Time period
1820-2010 (decennial, usually referring to xxx0 years, sometimes the decennial average: see How was life).

11. Geographical coverage
Global

12. Methodologies used for data collection and processing
The composite measure is a linear combination of the 9 variables created through a latent variable model. In the Bayesian implementation of the latent variable model, missing data is handled by the model. This provides estimates even for countries for which there is very little information. The uncertainty of these estimates is reflected in the confidence intervals, but be careful not to over-interpret the mean or median values for these countries.

13. Data quality
Depends on the underlying data; beyond that the quality should be reflected in the confidence intervals. Note that the assumptions of the latent variable model should also hold. See the background paper (Rijpma 2016) as well as the material this measure was based on (esp. Jackman 2009 and Høyland et al. 2012).
