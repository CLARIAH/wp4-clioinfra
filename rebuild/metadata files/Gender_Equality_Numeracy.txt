9. Abstract (200 words)

To measure educational equality between the sexes, we define a measure
of “gender equality” (GE) as 

 

where whf and whm are the Whipple Indices of females and males,
respectively. Thus, the higher our measure of gender equality, the lower
the share of women rounding up or down their age in comparison to men
rounding up or down in a certain country. A positive (negative) gender
equality index implies a female (male) numeracy advantage. Most of the
time, the index will be negative. We formulate this as gender equality
in order to make it more easily comparable with the literature on female
labor force participation rates (Goldin 1995, Mammen and Paxson 2000).
Of course, this does not imply that our countries were characterized by
gender “equality” between 1880 and 1949.

10. Time period

	1810 -1960. All data refer to the birth decadal average (1810 means
1810-19 etc)

11. Geographical coverage

	Worldwide

12. Methodologies used for data collection and processing

	Reconstruction of equality of basic numeracy by birth decade using a
variety of different sources. See also the text below. 

13. Data quality

	As good as possible, but counter-checking and improvement welcome.
Interpretations on individual country level should be done with careful
checking. In the ClioInfra quality coding, none of the ABCC obtains a 1
(“official governmental statistic”) or a 4 (“Conjecture,
guesstimate). All the ABCCs which are based on UN Demographic Yearbooks
or which contain the word “Census” in the title referenced in the
bibliography/list of references should obtain a 2, because those ABCC
values are calculated with official statistical data, but by the
authors, not by the government. All other estimates should obtain a 3.

14. Date of collection

	See references

15. Data collectors

	Joerg Baten, Kerstin Manzel, Valeria Prayon, Dorothee Crayen, Dácil
Juif, Ralph Hippe, Christina Mumme, and many colleagues from around the
world.

16. Sources

None of the Whipple estimates of the modestly sized literature entered
the data set unchanged, three general references which should be cited
(because they reflect most of the literature) are

This following is an excerpt of the paper Manzel and Baten (2010). For
the citation see above.

Age heaping has been used a number of times recently to measure
education levels (Mokyr 1983, Crayen and Baten 2008a and 2008b,
A’Hearn, Baten and Crayen 2009, de Moor and van Zanden 2008, Clark
2007, Manzel 2007, Baten, Crayen and Manzel 2008, see also the
applications in Cinnirella 2008, Mironov 2006, O’Grada 2006). It
describes the phenomenon that people tend to round up or down their age,
mostly in multiples of five, when asked how old they are. The main
reasons for this are lack of knowledge about their real age or lack of
numerical discipline. Consequently, estimating the degree of age heaping
gives us information about the educational system as well as about
institutions in a society. 

As early as the 1950s Bachi (1951) and Myers (1954) found a correlation
between the degree of age heaping and literacy. Mokyr (1983) was the
first to apply age heaping as a proxy variable for the educational level
of a population in order to investigate whether there was a brain drain
from pre-famine Ireland. Studies find a strong negative correlation
between age heaping and literacy or schooling, such as Crayen and Baten
(2008b) for the 19th and 20th centuries, A’Hearn, Baten and Crayen
(2009) for the 19th century U.S. states and the countries of Europe
during the early modern period, Manzel and Baten (2008) for Argentina
during the 19th century, and Nagi, Stockwell and Snavley (1973) for
African countries of the mid-20th century. To measure the degree of age
heaping, various indices can be used. A’Hearn, Baten and Crayen (2009)
show that the Whipple Index is most appropriate for this purpose. It
determines the tendency of age heaping on the digits 5 and 0 and is
calculated by taking the ratio of the sum of people reporting an age
ending on multiples of five and the total sum of people in a certain age
range. This ratio is then multiplied by 500. Meaningful interpretations
of the index vary between 100 and 500. In the case of 100, no age
heaping on multiples of five is present, in the case of 500, the age
data contain only digits ending in multiples of five (Hobbs 2004). 

 

Hence, the Whipple Index (Wh) gives us information about numeracy skills
or numerical discipline and can be used as a proxy for an important
component of the educational level of a population. The calculation of
the Whipple Index requires single age data for ten successive years, so
that each terminal digit appears once. Mortality will have the effect
that fewer people are alive at age 44 than at age 40, and at age 49 than
at age 45, which could bias the Whipple Index downwards (Crayen and
Baten 2008a). Therefore we choose the age groups 23-32, 33-42 etc. to
overcome this problem. We exclude age data for under 23-year olds,
because many young males and females married in their early twenties or
late teens and had to register as voters, military conscripts etc. On
such occasions, they were sometimes subject to age requirements, a
condition which gave rise to increased age awareness. Moreover,
individuals grow physically during this period, which makes it easier to
determine their age with a relatively high accuracy. Age information for
over 72-year olds is not included as age statements of older people
involve several problems: age exaggeration, survivor bias, higher
mortality of males (Del Popolo 2000) and other household members who
report the ages of older persons play a more pronounced role than at
younger ages. 

The Whipple Index is defined inversely, i.e. it represents lack of
numeracy rather than numeracy. For an easier interpretation, A’Hearn,
Baten and Crayen (2009) suggested another index, the ABCC index. It
transforms the Whipple Index and yields an estimate of the share of
individuals who correctly report their age:

 .

The method of approximating educational levels with age heaping
behaviour certainly has its deficiencies in measuring human capital, as
misreporting of ages may also have political or cultural reasons. The
degree to which age heaping is influenced by schooling and the effect of
other institutional factors is not easy to disentangle, although Crayen
and Baten (2008b) assessed this and found that schooling was more
important than other factors such as bureaucracy and previous
census-taking. We conclude that -- at least in the absence of other
indicators – age heaping is a valuable instrument to approximate the
development of human capital. 

Gender equality 

To measure educational equality between the sexes, we define a measure
of “gender equality” (GE) as 

 

where whf and whm are the Whipple Indices of females and males,
respectively. Thus, the higher our measure of gender equality, the lower
the share of women rounding up or down their age in comparison to men
rounding up or down in a certain country. A positive (negative) gender
equality index implies a female (male) numeracy advantage. Most of the
time, the index will be negative. We formulate this as gender equality
in order to make it more easily comparable with the literature on female
labor force participation rates (Goldin 1995, Mammen and Paxson 2000).
Of course, this does not imply that our countries were characterized by
gender “equality” between 1880 and 1949.

 A Whipple Index of 0 is theoretically possible and would mean an
avoidance of ages ending in 5 and 0. However, values below 95-100 are
uncommon.

 A 17-year-old might round up/down to 18 or 16, but not to 15 or 20.
Moreover, children were excluded because of a high likelihood that the
parents rather than the child himself answered the question.

 effect becomes visible from the age of 70 onwards, in others only from
the age of 80. In order to obtain reliable results, we exclude those
older than 72 from our analysis.
